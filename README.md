scripts that i created feel free to use them and *SOME* scripts is open source.

Do note that the script *Some Admin* have Webhook logger(which means this scripts when executed makes a webhook in my private discord server sends a message, the message that will be sent something like "localplayer(your username) have executed Some admin").
i just wanted to see how many people execute my script
